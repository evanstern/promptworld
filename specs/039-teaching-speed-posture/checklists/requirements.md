# Specification Quality Checklist: Teaching-World Speed Posture (Calibrated Soft Cap)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No clarification markers: decision-6 (accepted 2026-07-23) and
  docs/design/horizon-vs-learner-iteration-speed.md pre-answer the shape questions
  (soft vs hard cap, planner-safe rung as the default, budget overrides rejected,
  uncalibrated prompt requirement, per-world config not engine rule) — per
  constitution Principle I, resolved from artifacts, not re-asked.
- Validation run 2026-07-24: all items pass on first iteration.
